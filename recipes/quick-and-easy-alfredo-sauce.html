    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Alfredo sauce is a creamy pasta sauce that's frequently paired with
      fettuccine. The iconic dish, fettuccine Alfredo, is an Italian menu
      staple. According to legend, the dish was invented by a Roman chef named
      Alfredo di Lelio in the early 1900s. Di Lelio's pregnant wife was
      struggling to keep any food down, so he tossed pasta in the simple buttery
      sauce of his own creation. He added fettuccine Alfredo to his restaurant's
      menu soon after.

        milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps. Stir in Parmesan
